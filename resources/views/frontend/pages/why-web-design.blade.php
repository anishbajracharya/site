                               <h5> by DigitalTerai | Mar 7, 2019 | Web Design Blog |</h5>
                                <br>

                                  <p>  The first impression is the last impression and that’s where the importance of professional web design comes in.
                                   8 out of 10 visitors will judge your brand based on their first visit to your website. This means that even if you provide
                                    a top-notch product or service in your domain but lack a professional web design, you will lose the trust in the eyes of your
                                     audience.</p> <br>
                                    <br>
                                  <p> <span><a href="../">Digital marketing</a></span> has made it simpler to highlight any business and make
                                   them popular on short notice. But is that as simple as you think? Let me tell you
                                    <span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2015/01/16/90-of-startups-will-fail-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-10/">
                                    more than 60% of startup fail each year</a></span>. There is more competition in the market than you think. Everyone has their own goals
                                     and ambitions. But to sustain in this competitive market, you got to be more creative. And It is a well-designed business website that can achieve these.</p> <br>
                                    <br>
                                   <p>  People invest a lot of money and time in online marketing
                                   but it seems to be worthless if your website is not of high quality. In Today’s world, good website design is the best choice for any
                                    business to get noticed by their customers and to be popular.</p>
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h3> What is web design?</h3>
                                    <br>
                                   <p> Simply, It is the process of designing a website with a combination of different layout and style to make it more attractive
                                   and feasible for customers. A website can be used for multiple purposes. It can be used to showcase your product or service for your
                                    customer or can be used to present your business information and make people aware of your online existence.</p>
                                    <br>
                                  <p>  A website can also be used as your 24/7 customer representative. It is shocking but the truth that some businesses don’t even
                                   have a website for their online presence. What is worth of your investment when people are unable to reach you? Being a business owner
                                    you need to know what your customer wants from your side. That is one of the losses for your business when you don’t have a website.
