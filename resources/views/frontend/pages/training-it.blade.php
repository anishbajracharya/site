                            <br> Many IT companies have a vacant post but they are not getting more professionals; Why?
                            Even every year a lot of students have been graduated with good scores/marks, yet they are
                            facing unemployment problems till now. Because most of the graduated students lack the
                            industry-oriented learning experience. They have got good theoretical knowledge but due to a
                            lack of tools and techniques, they can't get opportunities to implement their knowledge.
                            Focusing on market demand, many training institutes are established to provide training to
                            the fresh graduate.
