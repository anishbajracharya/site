                               <h2> Turn your visitors into customers</h2><br>
                               <p> Turning your visitors into customers is the ultimate goal of any <span><a href="/">digital marketing</a></span>  campaign
                                and you don’t really need a ninja masterplan for it? And it’s also not about following customers or
                                 giving them huge discounts.</p>

                               <p> However, it’s true that customers retaining generate 25% to 90% possibility for making a business
                                remain to the top. We are usually mistaken that once people start to retail with our product, it’s enough 
                                to have them forever. But it’s actually not the truth. Every second, the world is creating different innovations
                                 presently. People are shifting to new technology very rapidly that was beyond the expectation. Similarly, Your 
                                 customers also want to hear something different and creative in order to steal their expectations.</p>

                              <p> Even grocery shop gets questioned that ‘’what’s new in your shop today?  If you are not checking
                               statistics of visitor conversion then it’s a waste of your effort and money that you are paying. Before 
                               analysing loss data, it’s better to learn the reason.</p> <br>

                              <h2>  Importance of Customers retention.</h2><br>
                              <div class="mid">
                              <img class="blog" src="images/blog5.jpg" alt="">
                              </div>


                              <p>  Before jumping on the final steps of customers retention process let’s first have a look towards why
                               it is so important to retain customers for business promotions.</p><br>
                               <div style="padding-left: 29px;">

                              <h3>  1. Cost-effective</h3><br>
                              <p>  Retention of old customers is cheaper than a new one. It costs altogether more to procure another
                               client than it does to hold a current one. So spare your cash and diminish your promoting costs by keeping
                                your old clients who are familiar with your products.</p><br>

                               <h3> 2. Chance for repeat profit</h3><br>
                               <p>Valued customers are more likely interested in your product compare to the new one. They are familiar
                                with your values and services which keep them trading with you for a long period. This helps to grow the business
                                more profitable sustainably. Existing customers are 10 times keener to buy from you than a new lead. They understand
                                 your decision and are already satisfied with your service. They have already trust you that you listen to their
                                  needs.</p> <br>

                             <h3>  3. Old customer will value your service</h3> <br>
                             <p>  Long-lasting customers are far less price-conscious compared to the new one. They have already valued your
                              service and ready to pay for it. Usually, customers seek quality service and price but retained customers
                               believed that you meet their requirement which is a beneficial part of business growth. Retained customers lead 
                               to word of mouth marketing which leads to an increase in both sales &amp;brand.</p> <br>
                                </div>
                              <h2>  Things to be done for converting a visitor into customers.</h2><br>
                              <p> Analysing visitor’s growth graph on your site is really awesome but what are the benefits of exploration 
                              if one is not interested to be with you? Even in a simple relationship staying of the person in your life is more 
                              important than the meeting. In the sector of the business relationship between clients and the company is symbiotic
                               where both parties are benefited by each other.</p> <br>

                               visitors so that they remain with you for long. Let’s have a look at some points that encourage us on the knowledge of

                             <img class="blog"  src="images/blog6.jpg" alt="">
                             </div>

                              and level of professionalism of the company. As it’s said, ‘The first impression is the last impression’, similarly
                               website plays a vital role in putting a first nice impression on visitor's eye and makes them interested to know more

                             <div class="mid">
                             <img class="blog" src="images/bl2.png" alt="">
                             </div>

                                or creativity. Similarly, while coming to the website it is important to be ranked at the top by Google so that

                              <div class="mid">
                              <img class="blog" src="images/blog9.jpg" alt="">
                              </div>

                                that result in effective lead generations.</p> <br>

                             <h3>   8. Loading speed</h3><br>
                              <p> Speed load to open a website is one of the irritating parts of any visitors. No one likes to get stuck in one
                               single thing for a long time. So in case of attracting more customers, it is important to make site visits more 
                               efficient and reduce buffering.</p> <br>

                              <div class="mid">
                              <img class="blog" src="images/blog10.png" alt="">
                              </div>


                               <p> Professional touch on presentations gives a field to make people think about you. Working style,
                                dealing measure with others is likely a more convincing factor for converting any visitors to customers.  
                                It’s doesn’t matter how big your company area is, how big is your team, or how much you have invested in the business 
                                but first thing that keeps the priority on influencing people is your presentation & what level of your 
                                professionalism you show in front of the visitor.</p><br>

                              <h3>  10. Don’t forget retargeting</h3><br>
                              <p> Following people is usually not considered a good thing but not in case of business because unless you
                               didn’t target them continuously business will not grow so well. It’s like giving them a priority or special zone
                                in your customer’s list. You might have received unlimited calls from the call centre regarding their product and
                                 at last, you will have a look in their service which might have made you forever customers of them. This is an 
                                 unconditional power of retargeting where visitors could be converted on clients ultimately.</p> <br>

                              <h3> 11. Allow free trial</h3> <br>
                              <p>  Before buying anything human nature forces them to have a try and also for free. We have seen and also even
                               might have asked a question to the salesman, if I am allowed to try once or not and if the answer is no then we
                                hardly buy the product, isn’t it? Similarly, in the case of an online product, you should allow customers to have
                                 a trail section for positive impacts.</p><br>

                             <h3>  12. Show Proof</h3> <br>
                               <p> If well-known people of industry have tried your product then mention it on your site. This helps your site
                                to get a more positive response and trust of customers towards your company. Social proof is the best way to convince
                                the product. You enable them to know that they are not dealing with new product and want them to infuse
                                 confidently.</p><br>
                                 </div>
