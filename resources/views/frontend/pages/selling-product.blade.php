                              <h2> Demerits of Selling Products on Facebook</h2>  <br>

                                of decreasing user engagement &amp; increasing platform dependency. Besides these, There are few limitations
                                 that come with selling products on Facebook to grow your business. Some of them includes:</p> <br>
                                 <div style="padding-left: 29px;">
                              <h3>&bull; Platform Dependency</h3>  <br>
                               <p> If you have ever tried throwing ads or boosting posts on Facebook, you might be already aware
                                 of the acebook dependency strategy. Selling products on Facebook seems quite fascinating because
                                  of the ease &amp; classic interface. But at the same time, you will not even realize how fast your business
                                   has got dependent upon Facebook for any leads or sales.  </p>

                               <h3>&bull; Decreasing Organic reach &amp;User engagement</h3>
                               <br>
                               <div class="mid">
                                    <img class="blog"  src="images/blog3.jpg" alt="">
                                    </div>
                                <br>
                               <p>Facebook allows you to do marketing &amp; boost your posts only until you pay for it.
                               You only get sales &amp; leads as long as you pay to Facebook. Once you stop paying, you stop
                               getting leads and that’s the dark side of this amazing Social media platform. You are fully
                               dependent on Facebook boosting for your business growth which is a bit hard for any start-up companies.</p>  <br>

                              <h3>&bull; Expensive</h3> <br>
                              <p>  Though Selling products on Facebook seems cheaper marketing platform compared to other social
                              media but due to its continued boosting strategies, it can turn quite expensive for small &amp; medium business
                               budgets holder. Facebook pages need to be updated every time with new content and new images for better results
                                of leads, meaning you got to invest time, manpower &amp; resources for them.</p>
                                <br>
                              <h3>&bull; Facebook Guidelines and moderation</h3>  <br>
                              <div class="mid">
                              <img class="blog"  src="images/blog4.jpeg" alt="">
                              </div>


                              <p>  Facebook is the best way to reach people as much as we want and it allows users to share their site
                               link on its pages. Millions of people are engaged with this social media and finding interested customers is
                                not a great deal. But when it comes to Facebook, they have their own sort of guidelines &amp; moderation.</p>
<br>
                              <p>  Facebook has grown up to become more &amp; more strict &amp; moderated because of its large community.
                               And this has created a kind of firewall of some businesses selling products on their platform. Facebook,
                                in the year 2018 divided news feed into two categories: user feed &amp; page feed making it nearly impossible
                                 for publishers to reach their target audience without paying to Facebook.</p>
<br>
                              <p>  Moreover, policies like link moderation, profile scrutiny, and ads inspection have made it more
                              difficult for some industries to achieve their marketing goal.</p> <br>

                             <h3>&bull; No Long Term Approach</h3>  <br>
                             <p>  Selling products on Facebook might prove great marketing tactics for a short period of time.
                              But when it comes to long term benefits, Facebook is far below than a website. Facebook marketing requires
                               lots of resources and time. Traffic on your pages is not available all the time so you have to do lots of
                                promotions to insist people to view your product.</p>  <br>

                           <p>   Even though if you get lots of followers, you have to do lots of interaction and keep you active
                           to account all the time to solve their queries. These things take a high effort and pressure that a person might
                            get stressed and frustrated equally.</p>   <br>

                             <p> It causes high budgets and high effort at the same time which might not be a sustainable decision
                              for any product to get promotions. Apart from this, it’s never a good idea to depend on a third-party platform
                               for a longer business run.</p>   <br>

                            <h3>&bull; Website as the Solution:</h3>  <br>
                          <p>    A well designed responsive website can be a great solution for this approach. Having a website for your
                           business helps you to advertise in fewer expenses and you are allowed to advertise offline as well. The website plays
                           a friendly role when it comes to marketing.</p>   <br>

                              <p><span><a href="/what-is-seo">SEO </a></span> is an important part of business growth which is only possible through the website rather than any
                               other online marketing panels. A website makes it easier for your customers are easier to reach you. It allows
                               customers to order your product online which is more convenient for them rather than walking to your store. The
                                website lets you sell your product online and promote your business without being dependent upon 3rd party
                                 platform. A website is more accessible compared to other media.</p>
                                 <br>
                              <p>  People are able to reach you whenever they need and where ever they are and also provide an
                               opportunity to increases your sells. Everything has cons and pros but switching to the side that has
                                fewer limitations is wiser decisions. Instead of investing in Facebook for some less expense at present
                                 and loosing double in the future, it’s better to create a personal website with more expenses presently
                                  and gaining more in the future.</p> <br>
                                  </div>

                           <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>  <br>
                             <p>   Yes, selling products on Facebook is a good option to some extent in order to promote your product
                              and services but not sustainable. It will be costly and pressurizing at the same time. Facebook provides a
                               smart platform to increase your brand awareness &amp; user engagement but when it comes to generating traffic &
                                sales, the website leaves Facebook far behind.</p> <br>

                            <p>  You will get more followers and likes for your marketing but not valued customers. For a sustainable
                             run of business, one should build their own personal online platforms and that is only possible with the Website.
                              It is recommended to focus more on a long term convincing business strategy, i.e. website over Facebook. So,
                               this was all about the pros &amp; cons of selling products on Facebook.</p>  <br>

                             <p> What do you think about Facebook marketing for your business? Is a website more important than a
                              Facebook page? Let us know your thoughts in the comment below. And if you want website design service in Nepal,
