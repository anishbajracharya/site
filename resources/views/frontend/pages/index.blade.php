                                             on a search engine page with websites of various travel &amp; tour agencies.

                                             using this keyword in Nepal. Let’s say you managed to attract only 10% of

                                             which results in 13.8 (approx 14) qualifies leads for your business,
                                             absolutely
                                             for free, that too from a single keyword.
