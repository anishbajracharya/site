                                <h1 style="font-size: 3.5rem;"> SEO Benefits for business in Nepal</h1>
                               <h5> by DigitalTerai | Feb 17, 2019 | SEO Blog |</h5><br>

                               <p>“We have been running our business for the last 10 years and already doing good. We get a good number of clients during peak season and are satisfied with the earning. Why should I invest my extra bucks on an extra marketing channel”, said one of my friends (A travel business owner) while discussing SEO benefits for business in Nepal?
</p><br>


                              <p>  There are many small business owners and startups like him who are not quite aware of internet marketing and think it’s not worth spending bucks on any marketing channel like SEO.
</p><br>

                               <p>If you think of the traditional perspective of business, they are 100% correct and justified in their case. Just think about it. What sort of techniques did companies like CG & Hulas in Nepal use that made them such a tycoon in a decade</p><br>

                               <p> They had an amazing product (useful for people).</p><br>
                               <p> They marketed their product very well. Maximum of us have grown up watching those noodles & electronics advertisements on TV.</p><br>
                               <p> They had a large investment for product & marketing because you can’t manufacture such a large quantity and more importantly, you can’t market your products with such hype without having millions of backup</p>
                               <p>This above example implies that you had to invest the maximum of your budget in marketing & advertising in order to establish a brand back in those days. And that’s what companies like CG &Hulas did in the past. And not to mention, they are successful in their own ways.
</p> <br>


                              <p>  But now, the scenario is completely different. You don’t need to be a millionaire to earn millions. Even a small business owner with a good product can create a brand without investing such a large budget and that’s where the power of digital marketing comes in.</p><br>

                              <p>  Digital marketing is the process of utilizing various digital channels in order to deliver your message to a group of preferred audience at low or no cost. Here, Digital channels imply various platforms you can use to grow your business online. Based on costing, those digital channels can be categorized into two parts:
</p><br>

                              <p>  Paid channels ( Facebook ads, Google Ads, PPC marketing, etc)
</p><br>
                             <p>  Unpaid channel (SEO)</p> <br>
                               <p> In this article, we are going to discuss unpaid channel of online marketing which can be used to establish
                                your business brand on the internet. So, <span><a href="https://digitalterai.com/what-is-seo">What is SEO?</a></span> What benefits can you get from SEO as a business owner?</p><br>


                              <p> Gone are those days when people were excited about watching movies on NTV every Saturday and Tito Satya on Friday. You won’t even see baje (old people) listening to radios in the street these days. People no longer play indoor games for time pass. And you know, most of the people have given up text messaging even in Nepal.
</p> <br>

                               <p> So, where are those people gone now?
</p><br>

                              <p> Well, those people have just transformed their lifestyles with the advent of the internet. People these days prefer Viber & Messenger rather than text messaging. They play Ludo classic neo instead of other indoor games. Nowadays, People have the choice to watch their favorite tv , shows & movies online on Youtube & Netflix. That’s why we no longer wait for NTV Saturday movie show now. </p> <br>

                               <p> This Internet has really transformed our lives in the last few years surprisingly. And you know what, people don’t even ask others for finding products or services like we used to do in the early days. So, what do we do then?
</p><br>

                               <p> Let’s take an example of yourself</p>
                               <br>
                              <p>  What would you do if you had to find a consultancy for your abroad study? Probably, you will ask some of your friends or search on Google.

                              </p><br>

                               <p> If you preferred to search on Google even after getting several recommendations from your friends & relatives, congrats, you are not alone. More than 90% of people in Nepal use search engines either to search for information or to validate the information they get from their near ones.
</p><br>

                               <p> Something like this:</p>
                               <div class="mid">
                               <img class="blog" src="images/blog0.jpg" alt="">
                               </div>
                               <br>





                              <p> What happens now? You find a number of education consultancies displayed on the Google page. You probably click one or two of the top results, scan them, validate them and maybe call one of them for further queries & information.
</p><br>

                               <p> Think about this as a business owner now.</p>

                               <p>Students from all over Nepal are willing to move abroad for their career or further studies & 9/10 of them use a search engine to find an authentic consultancy for their next step.

                               </p> <br>

                              <p>  So, don’t you think you would like to reside on the top of Google whenever any student searches for consulting services?

</p><br>

                               <p> And Let me tell you there is 480 number of people who are searching for you each month using that single keyword “Education consultancy in Nepal” from just Google. Here is the data from Google itself.
</p><br>
                               <div class="mid">
                               <img class="blog" src="/images/blog1.jpg" alt="">
                               </div>



                               <h3> Let’s do some Math now:</h3><br>

                             <p>  If you are a consultancy owner in Nepal and your business doesn’t appear on the first page of Google if someone searches with that keyword, You are probably losing 480 customers each month and 480*12=5400 customers every year by not optimizing your website for that keyword on Google.
</p>

                              <p> Now imagine your website is optimized for tens & hundreds of those keywords. This is just an example. Your business can be related to anything from education consultancy to healthcare to news & media to travel & tourism to products selling to anything you can imagine.
</p> <br>

                               <p> Ok now, are you regretting not optimizing your website to appear on the first page of Google? I can understand the feelings and that’s what I explained to my friend when he asked me why he should invest his extra bucks on SEO for his business.
</p><br>

                              <h2>  Benefits Of SEO For Business</h2><br>
                              <p>  SEO or search engine optimization is the combination of various tools & techniques in order to optimize
                               your website so that it appears on the top result of Google when people search for your products or services
                                online. It’s SEO that can increase your business searchability & visibility on search engines. SEO is also a
                                great technique to optimize your website for users and increase its user experience and therefore building your
                             brand & credibility on the web. Having said that let me enlist a few SEO benefits for business in Nepal:
</p>
                                 <br>
                                 <div style="padding-left: 29px;">
                              <h3>&bull; Increase Organic Search Traffic</h3><br>
                               <p>If you have ever thrown ads on Facebook or Google, You must be aware that those PPC ads can only bring traffic & sales to your business as long as you pay to those platforms. Once you stop paying, you will stop getting customers. And this increases your dependency on those platforms. Unlike those ads, SEO is the unpaid form of Digital marketing that increases your organic traffic for the long run. This means that you don’t have to pay to Google or Facebook for bringing traffic to your website. It is SEO that does the magic.

</p> <br>


                              <h3>&bull;  Builds Trust &amp;Credibility</h3><br>
                               <p>Getting yourself on the top result of Google & other search engines ultimately increases your trust & credibility among searchers, As I mentioned earlier, more than 90% of people search on Google to discover & validate products. And if you appear on the top of Google, it ultimately increases your reputation in front of their eyes.

</p> <br>


                              <h3>&bull;  Better User Experience</h3><br>
                               <p>The main goal of SEO is to optimize your website for both users &search engines. This means that your website is optimized for a good crawlability &a better user experience. A professional SEO help builds a good website structure, navigation elements, contents,   setups, and other factors to increase overall user experience. Because in the end, It’s the user that matters to a business.

                              <p> Optimizing your website with SEO ensures that you appear to the searches in front of their eyes right when they are looking for it.

                               <p> Unlike <span><a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/examples-traditional-marketing-20423.html"> Traditional marketing channels</a></span>
                               like TV/radio Ads, Newspaper publishing, sticking pamphlets &amp;
                               billboards polluting all around the city, SEO can be done at a nominal cost and bring more sales &amp; results.

                                help you formulate further strategies.</p><br>
